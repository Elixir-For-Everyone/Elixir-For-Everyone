=== Interactive Shell

One of the easiest ways to execute Elixir commands is by simply running
the `iex` command on Linux and macOS, or `iex.bat` on Windows, since
the iex command there is a PowerShell command in the terminal.

IEX stand for Interactive Elixir

[source,bash]
----
$ iex
Erlang/OTP 27 [erts-15.1.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:1] [jit:ns]

Interactive Elixir (1.17.3) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)>
----

NOTE: To exit the Interactive shell just press `CTRL+C` twice.

Examples of Interactive Shell

[source,elixir]
----
iex(1)> 1 + 2
3
iex(2)> 1.1 + 2
3.1
iex(3)> 6 / 2
3.0
iex(4)> IO.puts("This is a text")
This is a text
:ok
----

[NOTE]
====
The `:ok` is a common convention in Elixir and Erlang to signify
that a function has completed without errors. It can be useful for
confirming that an operation, such as printing to the console, has
been executed properly.
