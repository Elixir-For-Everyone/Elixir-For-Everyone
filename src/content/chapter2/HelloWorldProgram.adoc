=== Hello World Program

Let us take our first steps in elixir language by writing a hello world script

[source,elixir]
----
IO.puts("Hello World")
----
Save this to the file `hello.exs`

Now run the file using following command

[source,bash]
----
$ elixir hello.exs
Hello World
----

[NOTE]
====
There are two types of extensions that you will find for elixir programs
`.exs` and `.ex`. `.exs` files are used for scripting purposes which can be 
used for testing purposes while `.ex` files are which are compiled into bytecode
as a part of library.
